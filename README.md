Example of a python and pyspark glue script each implementing a simple logic and passing data further, trigger also

Examples of a Python script and a PySpark script within AWS Glue, each implementing a simple logic and passing data further, along with triggers for execution:

Python Glue Script Example:


import sys
from awsglue.utils import getResolvedOptions
from pyspark.context import SparkContext
from awsglue.context import GlueContext
from awsglue.job import Job

# Create a GlueContext
args = getResolvedOptions(sys.argv, ['JOB_NAME'])
sc = SparkContext()
glueContext = GlueContext(sc)
spark = glueContext.spark_session
job = Job(glueContext)
job.init(args['JOB_NAME'], args)

# Define a simple logic
def process_data(record):
    # Implement your logic here
    transformed_record = record.upper()
    return transformed_record

# Read input data
input_data = glueContext.create_dynamic_frame.from_catalog(database = "your_database", table_name = "your_table")

# Apply logic to each record
transformed_data = input_data.map(transform = process_data)

# Write transformed data to output location
glueContext.write_dynamic_frame.from_options(frame = transformed_data, connection_type = "s3", connection_options = {"path": "s3://your_bucket/your_output_path"})

job.commit()
PySpark Glue Script Example:

python
Copy code
import sys
from awsglue.utils import getResolvedOptions
from pyspark.context import SparkContext
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Create a SparkContext and SparkSession
args = getResolvedOptions(sys.argv, ['JOB_NAME'])
sc = SparkContext()
spark = SparkSession.builder.config("spark.sql.catalogImplementation", "hive").enableHiveSupport().getOrCreate()

# Define a simple logic
def process_data(record):
    # Implement your logic here
    transformed_record = record.upper()
    return transformed_record

# Read input data
input_data = spark.read.table("your_database.your_table")

# Apply logic to each record
transformed_data = input_data.rdd.map(process_data).toDF()

# Write transformed data to output location
transformed_data.write.mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("your_database.your_output_table")

sc.stop()
To trigger the execution of the Glue scripts, you can set up a trigger based on various events. For example, using AWS Glue console, you can create a trigger to execute the script on a schedule (e.g., daily, hourly) or based on specific events like data arrival in an S3 bucket. You can configure the trigger settings and associate it with the Glue job to automate the execution based on your requirements.

Note: Replace "your_database", "your_table", "your_output_path", and "your_bucket" with the actual names and paths specific to your use case.

example of iam role, policy and related scripts
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's an example of an IAM role, a corresponding IAM policy, and sample scripts that demonstrate the usage of the IAM role for accessing AWS services:

IAM Role Example:
IAM Role Name: MyEC2Role
IAM Role Description: This role provides permissions for an EC2 instance to access S3.

IAM Policy Example:
IAM Policy Name: MyS3AccessPolicy
IAM Policy Description: Allows read-only access to an S3 bucket.

IAM Policy JSON:

json
Copy code
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket/*"
        }
    ]
}
Python Script Example:
Assuming the EC2 instance has the IAM role assigned, you can use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to access S3 using the IAM role's permissions.

python
Copy code
import boto3

# Create a session with the IAM role credentials
session = boto3.Session()

# Create an S3 client using the IAM role credentials
s3_client = session.client('s3')

# Example: List objects in an S3 bucket
bucket_name = 'your-bucket'
response = s3_client.list_objects_v2(Bucket=bucket_name)

# Process the response
for object in response['Contents']:
    print(object['Key'])
AWS CLI Script Example:
If you have the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) installed, you can use the IAM role's permissions to interact with S3.

bash
Copy code
# Configure the AWS CLI with the IAM role credentials
aws configure

# Example: List objects in an S3 bucket
bucket_name='your-bucket'
aws s3 ls s3://$bucket_name/
In both examples, the IAM role assigned to the EC2 instance provides read-only access to the specified S3 bucket. You can customize the IAM policy and IAM role to grant different permissions as per your requirements. The Python script demonstrates the usage of the Boto3 library to interact with AWS services using the IAM role's credentials, while the AWS CLI script shows how to configure and use the CLI with the IAM role.

Remember to replace "your-bucket" with the actual name of your S3 bucket.

what other services use scripts in aws
ChatGPT
There are various AWS services that utilize scripts for automation, configuration, and interaction. Here are some notable AWS services that commonly involve scripting:

AWS Lambda:

AWS Lambda allows you to run serverless functions in response to events. Lambda functions are typically written as scripts using languages like Python, Node.js, Java, or PowerShell. These scripts define the code logic executed by Lambda when triggered.
AWS CloudFormation:

AWS CloudFormation enables infrastructure as code (IaC) by using templates written in YAML or JSON. CloudFormation scripts describe the desired AWS resource configuration and relationships, allowing you to provision and manage resources in a repeatable and automated manner.
AWS Elastic Beanstalk:

AWS Elastic Beanstalk simplifies application deployment and management. It supports various platforms and languages such as Java, .NET, Python, Node.js, PHP, Ruby, and Go. Elastic Beanstalk leverages configuration files and scripts to define the application's environment, dependencies, and deployment settings.
AWS Step Functions:

AWS Step Functions is a serverless workflow orchestration service. It allows you to define and execute workflows using state machines. Step Functions rely on JSON-based definition files where you define states, transitions, and actions, allowing you to script complex workflows.
Amazon EC2 User Data:

Amazon EC2 instances can run user data scripts during launch. User data scripts automate instance configurations, installations, and customizations. These scripts can be written using bash, PowerShell, or other scripting languages, and they execute when the instance starts.
AWS CLI and SDKs:

The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) and Software Development Kits (SDKs) provide programmatic access to AWS services. The CLI uses scripts to interact with services via the command line, while SDKs provide libraries and APIs for scripting with various programming languages.
AWS Glue ETL Scripts:

AWS Glue allows you to perform extract, transform, and load (ETL) operations on your data. Glue supports ETL scripts written using Apache Spark and Python. These scripts define the transformations and processing logic applied to your data.
AWS Data Pipeline:

AWS Data Pipeline enables data-driven workflows for data movement and transformation. It uses pipeline definition files written in JSON to specify data sources, activities, and transformations in a sequence. The pipeline definition file acts as a script that orchestrates the data workflow.
These are just a few examples of AWS services that utilize scripts. Depending on your use case and requirements, there may be other services and scenarios where scripting is involved for automation, configuration, and interaction with AWS resources.

ChatGPT
Certainly! Here are examples of Python scripts for AWS Lambda, AWS Glue ETL, and AWS Step Functions:

AWS Lambda Python Script Example:
This example demonstrates a simple AWS Lambda function written in Python. It retrieves a parameter value from AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store.

python
Copy code
import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Create an SSM client
    ssm_client = boto3.client('ssm')

    # Retrieve a parameter value from Parameter Store
    parameter_name = '/my-parameter'
    response = ssm_client.get_parameter(Name=parameter_name, WithDecryption=True)
    parameter_value = response['Parameter']['Value']

    # Return the parameter value
    return {
        'parameter_value': parameter_value
    }
AWS Glue ETL Python Script Example:
This example demonstrates a simple AWS Glue ETL script written in Python. It reads data from an S3 bucket, applies a transformation, and writes the transformed data to another S3 bucket.

python
Copy code
import sys
from awsglue.transforms import *
from awsglue.utils import getResolvedOptions
from pyspark.context import SparkContext
from awsglue.context import GlueContext
from awsglue.job import Job

# Create a GlueContext
args = getResolvedOptions(sys.argv, ['JOB_NAME'])
sc = SparkContext()
glueContext = GlueContext(sc)
spark = glueContext.spark_session
job = Job(glueContext)
job.init(args['JOB_NAME'], args)

# Read data from an S3 bucket
source_data = glueContext.create_dynamic_frame.from_catalog(database='my-database', table_name='my-table')

# Apply transformation
transformed_data = ApplyMapping.apply(
    frame=source_data,
    mappings=[("source_column", "string", "target_column", "string")],
    transformation_ctx="transformed_data"
)

# Write transformed data to another S3 bucket
glueContext.write_dynamic_frame.from_catalog(
    frame=transformed_data,
    database="my-database",
    table_name="my-output-table"
)

job.commit()
AWS Step Functions Python Script Example:
This example demonstrates a simple AWS Step Functions state machine written in Python. It defines a sequence of states to execute.

python
Copy code
import boto3

# Create a Step Functions client
stepfunctions_client = boto3.client('stepfunctions')

# Define the state machine definition
state_machine_definition = {
    "Comment": "A Hello World example of the Amazon States Language using a Pass state",
    "StartAt": "HelloWorld",
    "States": {
        "HelloWorld": {
            "Type": "Pass",
            "Result": "Hello, World!",
            "End": True
        }
    }
}

# Create the Step Functions state machine
state_machine_arn = stepfunctions_client.create_state_machine(
    name='HelloWorldStateMachine',
    definition=state_machine_definition,
    roleArn='arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyStepFunctionsRole'
)['stateMachineArn']

# Start the Step Functions state machine execution
execution_arn = stepfunctions_client.start_execution(
    stateMachineArn=state_machine_arn
)['executionArn']
These examples provide a starting point for AWS Lambda, AWS Glue ETL, and AWS Step Functions Python scripting. You can customize the scripts based on your specific requirements and use cases.
